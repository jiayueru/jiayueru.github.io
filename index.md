<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am currently a first-year Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). In 2020, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence as part of the inaugural cohort of the [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/) at Yuanpei College, Peking University. I was fortunate to be honored with the PKU Excellent Graduate Award.

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and my BS in Electronic Information Engineering at [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I also spent time at [Johns Hopkins](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), [Oxford VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/), and [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My biography is [here](./biography/).
