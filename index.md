## About Me

I am currently a first-year Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). In 2020, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence as part of the inaugural cohort of the [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/) at Yuanpei College, Peking University. I was fortunate to be honored with the PKU Excellent Graduate Award.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the fields of <strong>Robotics</strong> and <strong>Generative AI</strong>. Currently, I am focused on developing general and scalable learning algorithms for <strong>robotic manipulation</strong>, enabling robots to interact with the world in a stable and reliable manner. Additionally, I am deeply fascinated by how generative methods can empower robots to imagine, perceive, understand, and engage with their surroundings. In the future, I aspire to to further explore the intersection of generative techniques and robotics, investigating how these approaches can enhance robots' ability to learn and adapt to the complexities of the real world.
